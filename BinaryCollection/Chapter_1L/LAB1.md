### In this lab, I have learned some basic static skill with tools.
From the results of tools, we can get :
1. make sure the report on internet
2. information about when is the malware compiled
3. make sure if the malware is packed or not
4. what may the malware do with the import hints
5. host-based signature and network-based signatures
6. the purpose of such malware

From the result from VirusTotal, we can make sure that is there anyone know the malware and realize its functionality....and so on.

From Strings, we can get some related points even it's just a partial information. 
For example, from the picture above, we can get the string of **OpenProcess**, **KERNEL32.DLL**, **ADVAPI32.DLL**, **\SYSTEM32\WUPDMGR.EXE**, **WinEXEC**, **WriteFile**. With KERNEL32.DLL, I guess that it can search and write the filesystem. With ADVAPI32.DLL, it means the program can do something with permission. With WinEXEC and WriteFile, we can judge that it can write the file to the disk and executes it. In addition, we may know who is the target signature? It is \SYSTEM32\WUPDMGR.EXE.
Taking one more example in LAB01-1, I can find **CreateProcess** and **Sleep** in strings of it, and they are also commonly used as backdoors!

To analyze the malware, it is important for us to make sure that if there is any obfuscation or not. Two way in this lab, one is PEiD to see what types of packer the malware uses, the other way is by **strings** program. Why we use the strings again? When I practice for the lab01-02, I find that **nothing is found** about the packer in PEiD; however; I find the **UPX01**, **UPX02**, and **UPX03** strings in the program. UPX is one kind of packer, so I need to use the upxshell to decompress it first, then we can analyze it.
[UPX](https://upx.github.io/)

From the DependencyWalker, we can get information of import and export function of the program. For the example in the picture above, we know that it have import the function of KERNEL32.DLL and ADVAPI32.DLL. Again to analyze its functionality.

Resource Hacker can help us to extract and dump the content in section **.rsrc**.
